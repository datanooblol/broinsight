## Business Translation Framework

### Statistical Results to Business Language
**Correlation Analysis:**

**Hypothesis Testing:**
- Technical: "t-test p-value = 0.023, Cohen's d = 0.4"
- Business: "Significant difference between groups with medium practical impact - Group A performs 40% better on average"

**Outlier Detection:**
- Technical: "Isolation Forest anomaly score = -0.1"
- Business: "This transaction is unusual - 95% of similar transactions are much smaller amounts"

**Clustering Results:**
- Technical: "K-means with k=4, silhouette score = 0.72"
