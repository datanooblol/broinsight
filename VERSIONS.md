# Version History

## v0.1.3 (Current - Production Ready)

### Separated Concerns Architecture ✅
- **DataCatalog Enhancement**: Universal data ingestion with pandas DataFrames, local CSV files, and S3 support
- **Intelligent Profiling**: Automatic data quality assessment with caching to avoid re-profiling
- **BroInsight Specialization**: Clean LLM interface with task-specific methods (SQL generation, data quality assessment, question guidance)
- **Multi-Table Support**: Relationship management and cross-table analysis capabilities
- **Multiple Metadata Formats**: Specialized outputs for SQL generation, guidance, and data quality assessment
- **Production Architecture**: Maintainable design with clear separation between data management and AI logic

### Technical Achievements
- Comprehensive data profiling with field statistics and quality metrics
- Caching system prevents redundant profiling operations
- Relationship-aware SQL metadata generation
- Context-specific prompt formatting for different analysis tasks
- Extensible plugin architecture foundation

### Example Usage
```python
# Universal data loading and profiling
catalog = DataCatalog()
catalog.register("tips", tips_df, "Restaurant tips dataset")
catalog.profile_tables(["tips"])

# Add business context
catalog.add_field_descriptions("tips", field_descriptions)

# Specialized analysis
broinsight = BroInsight(model)
sql_response = broinsight.generate_sql(catalog.to_sql_metadata("tips"), "What's the average tip?")
quality_response = broinsight.assess_data_quality(catalog.to_dq_profile("tips"), "Is my data clean?")
```

## v0.1.2

### DataCatalog Foundation ✅
- **Universal Data Ingestion**: Support for pandas DataFrames, local CSV files, and S3 data sources
- **AWS Integration**: Secure S3 connectivity with credential chain and explicit key support
- **BroInsight Interface**: Clean separation between data management and LLM analysis
- **Metadata System**: Structured data profiling and quality assessment
- **Multi-Source Support**: Unified interface for different data sources

### Technical Implementation
- DataCatalog class with extensible source support
- BroInsight class with specialized analysis methods
- Automatic table profiling and metadata generation
- S3 integration with httpfs and DuckDB
- Foundation for relationship management

## v0.1.1

### Phase 2 Complete: Reliability & User Guidance ✅
- **Dynamic Flow Architecture**: Sophisticated flow-based system with conditional routing
- **3-Way Intelligent Routing**: Organize action routes to query/guide/default based on user intent
- **Error Handling & Retry System**: Automatic SQL error detection and retry with up to 3 attempts
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Graceful degradation to conversational help when retries fail
- **Guided Questions**: Smart routing to help users discover what they can ask about their data
- **Empty Result Detection**: Handles successful queries that return no data with user feedback
- **Complete Error Coverage**: All actions have comprehensive error handling and logging

### Technical Improvements
- Fixed retry logic bug (was allowing n+1 attempts instead of n)
- Added missing error handling to GuideQuestion and Organize actions
- Enhanced session logging with empty result detection
- Improved user experience for all failure scenarios
- Production-ready reliability across entire pipeline

### Flow Architecture
```
Start → UserInput → Organize → [3-way intelligent routing]
                      ├─ "guide" → GuideQuestion → UserInput (loop)
                      ├─ "select_metadata" → SelectMetadata → GenerateSQL → Retrieve → [error handling]
                      │                                                        ├─ retry → GenerateSQL (up to 3x)
                      │                                                        └─ fallback → Chat → UserInput
                      └─ "default" → Chat → UserInput (loop)
```

### Next: User Feedback Collection
- Gathering real-world usage patterns to inform Phase 3 architecture decisions
- Evaluating whether transparency features should be integrated or orchestrated separately
- Building plugin system foundation for extensible enhancements
