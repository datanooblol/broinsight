       "  'output_data': '**Short answer:**  \\nYes ‚Äì both items show strong sales momentum but are running close to depletion, and both are flagged as **High** risk for stock‚Äëout.\\n\\n| Product | Total sold | Stock left | Avg daily sales | Projected days until stock‚Äëout | Stock‚Äëout risk |\\n|---------|------------|------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|----------------|\\n| 170 ‚Äì Apple (Home) | 32 | 8 | 3.20 | **2.5** days | **High** |\\n| 124 ‚Äì Samsung (Clothing) | 46 | 36 | 3.54 | **10.2** days | **High** |\\n\\n### Why these are ‚Äúhigh‚Äësales, low‚Äëstock‚Äù cases\\n\\n- **Product\\u202f170**:  \\n  - Sold 32 units in 10 days ‚Üí ~3.2 units/day.  \\n  - Only 8 units remain, so the inventory will be exhausted in roughly 2¬Ω days.  \\n  - The ratio of sold to remaining stock is 4:1, indicating a very fast sell‚Äëthrough.\\n\\n- **Product\\u202f124**:  \\n  - Sold 46 units in 13 days ‚Üí ~3.5 units/day.  \\n  - 36 units remain, which is still a relatively small buffer given the daily sales rate.  \\n  - Even though the projected days until stock‚Äëout is longer (‚âà10 days), the risk is still flagged **High** because the current stock level is only about 3.5 times the daily sales rate, which is below many typical safety‚Äëstock thresholds.\\n\\n### What to do next\\n\\n1. **Re‚Äëorder or restock**:  \\n   - For product\\u202f170, consider an urgent replenishment to avoid a stock‚Äëout in just a few days.  \\n   - For product\\u202f124, plan a restock before the 10‚Äëday window closes, especially if demand is expected to rise.\\n\\n2. **Promotions or bundle offers**:  \\n   - If you want to accelerate sales for product\\u202f124, a promotion could help move inventory faster, but be careful not to deplete stock before the next shipment arrives.\\n\\n3. **Monitor sales trends**:  \\n   - Keep an eye on daily sales; if they spike, the projected stock‚Äëout dates will shrink.\\n\\n4. **Safety‚Äëstock review**:  \\n   - Re‚Äëevaluate your safety‚Äëstock policy. A higher buffer (e.g., 5‚Äì6√ó daily sales) would reduce the ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù risk classification.\\n\\nLet me know if you‚Äôd like help setting up a reorder schedule or analyzing how a promotion might affect these numbers!',\n",
