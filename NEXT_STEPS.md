# BroInsight Next Steps - Phase 3 Implementation

## Current Status (v0.1.1 - Pre-Launch)
âœ… **Phase 1**: Core agent functionality complete  
âœ… **Phase 2**: Reliability & error handling complete  
ðŸŽ¯ **Next**: Phase 3 - Transparency & Session Management

## Phase 3: Session Inspection & Transparency

### 1. Session Viewer Interface
**Goal**: Allow users to inspect their conversation history and system behavior

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Add query methods to `session_logger.py` for retrieving session data
- [ ] Create `SessionInspector` class for analyzing conversation flows
- [ ] Build methods to display:
  - Conversation history with action routing decisions
  - SQL queries generated and their success/failure
  - Retry attempts and error patterns
  - Token usage and performance metrics

### 2. Query Execution History
**Goal**: Track and analyze all SQL operations for optimization

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Enhance session logging to capture:
  - Query execution time
  - Result set sizes
  - Performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Create query analytics dashboard showing:
  - Most common query patterns
  - Success/failure rates by query type
  - Performance trends over time

### 3. Audit Trail System
**Goal**: Provide complete observability for debugging and optimization

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Build audit trail viewer showing:
  - User interaction patterns
  - Data exploration paths taken
  - Common failure points and resolutions
- [ ] Add session export functionality for sharing/debugging
- [ ] Create session replay capability for understanding user journeys

### 4. Metadata Exploration Assistant
**Goal**: Help users understand what data is available and how to query it

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Build interactive metadata browser
- [ ] Create "suggested questions" based on available data
- [ ] Add data profiling insights (value distributions, relationships)
- [ ] Implement smart query suggestions based on current context

## Technical Architecture for Phase 3

### New Components to Build:
1. **SessionInspector** - Query and analyze session logs
2. **QueryAnalytics** - Performance and pattern analysis
3. **MetadataExplorer** - Interactive data discovery
4. **AuditTrail** - Complete session observability

### Integration Points:
- Extend existing `session_logger.py` with query capabilities
- Add new methods to `BroInsight` class for inspection features
- Create notebook-friendly display methods for session data

## Development Priority Order:
1. **Session query methods** (foundation for everything else)
2. **Basic session viewer** (immediate user value)
3. **Query performance tracking** (optimization insights)
4. **Metadata exploration tools** (enhanced user guidance)

## Success Criteria for Phase 3:
- [ ] Users can view their complete conversation history
- [ ] System provides insights into query performance
- [ ] Users get intelligent suggestions for data exploration
- [ ] Complete audit trail available for debugging
- [ ] Session data can be exported/shared

## Post-Phase 3: Future Phases
- **Phase 4**: Visualization (automatic chart generation)
- **Phase 5**: Advanced insights (pattern discovery)
- **Phase 6**: Reporting (PDF generation, shareable summaries)
